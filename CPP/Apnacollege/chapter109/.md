<!--  Graph Starting  -->

## Edges and Vertices 

Edges based classification 

1. Edge direction :  Directed Graph ( Unidirection edge ,  undirected equal bidirection )
2. Edge Weight : values ,cost to move from one edge to other 

## Types 

1. undirected unweighted 
2. undirected weight 
3. directed unweighted 
4. undirected weight 

## Connected And Unconnected Graph 

## Adjacancy List (can be added from front or end )

Fucntions : push_back , push_front ,pop_front, pop_back
